Out of a standard 52-card deck, 4 cards are displayed at a time.
Make 24 by combining the numbers with +, -, *, /, (, and/or ).

Press your buzzer to submit an answer.
Player 1's buzzer is the 'a' key. Player 2's buzzer is the 'l' key.
Press 'n' if you think there is no solution.

You will receive 1 point for a correct solution, and lose 1 point for a wrong one.
If no solution is possible, there will be no change to the score.
Press the buzzer and enter the correct solution first to increase your score!

The game ends when all cards in the deck are played.

Press any key to continue.
